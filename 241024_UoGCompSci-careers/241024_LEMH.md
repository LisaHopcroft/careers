# Academic career (behind the scenes)

<div class="row">

  <div class="column">

  ### I felt...

  - No conscious career decisions 🎡
  <!------
  On a treadmill that I didn't know how to get off of
  ------>
  - One (undesirable) career trajectory 🔭
  - Didn't want to give up ⛏ for ✍🏻💰
  <!------
  I did not want to be a group leader
  ------>
  - Didn't know what else I could do
  <!------
  But I didn't know what else I could do - I didn't feel like I was trained well enough as a software developer, I was mostly working in isolation (technically)
  ------>
  - Half hearted job apps had failed

  </div>

  <div class="column">
  
  ### But...

  - I enjoyed collaborative work 👩🏻‍🔬👨🏻‍💻👩🏻‍⚕️
  - I enjoyed communication 👩🏻‍🏫📊📝
  - Drip feed of rewards 📰💰🏅
    ...
  - I didn't _HATE_ it all the time 😐

  <!------
  There was a lot that I did like about academia - working with others, building things, writing, visual communication - but a lot that I didn't like - funding applications, precariousness of contracts

# ...followed by a realisation...

- PDGE (Computing) - 18 weeks teaching in Paisley

![height:250](img/St_Andrews_Academy.jpg) ![height:250](img/Paisley-Grammar.jpg) 

- I enjoyed the actual teaching...and I was good at it
- I did not enjoy much else (📄📄📄📄📄, 🔔, 👦🏾👧🏼👦🏻👧🏽👦🏿👧🏻👦🏼👧🏾👦🏽👧🏿...)
- I really, _really_, _**really**_ missed the data and the coding 👩🏻‍💻

# So what now?

<div class="row">

  <div class="column40">

  ### I could have felt...

  - that I'd failed as an academic 
  - that I'd failed as a teacher
  - embarrassed that I was wrong

...but, in the end, it _was_ academia.

i.e., 
grant applications ✍🏻💰
short-term contracts 😵‍💫
no clear career trajectory 🔭

# A recap

# Industry vs academia (vs public services)

<!-------
I haven't worked in the private sector (yet)
There are no hard and fast rules, but...
--------->
- There are hard problems _everywhere_
<!-------
Academia does not have a monopoly on hard and important problems.

# My career hygiene habits

<!-------
Where I am
What I want
What I can learn
What I want to learn
--------->

- Regular, **diarised** reflection
- Look for new opportunities when I feel I've learned all (most) that I can
- Coach teenagers at [Castle Semple Rowing club](https://www.castlesemplerc.co.uk/) 🚣🏻‍♀️

# Take home messages

- Try to reflect as much as you can, preferably from a distance
<!----------
  - what do you enjoy?
  - how do you like to work?
  - what do you want to learn?
  - what gives you energy?
  
  In retrospect, what I enjoyed from the primary school visit was the communication, the connection with the kids (which I can now satisfy with coaching), being in
the world.
----------->
- Be confident that you have skills that are needed elsewhere, **because you do**
<!----------
You learn so much from working in academia, almost by accident. Writing, interpreting, reading, presenting, willingness to try things, how to collaborate.
----------->
- Talk to people and find out what is out there
  (you can email me at `lisa.hopcroft@nhs.scot`)
<!----------
Find out about the applications process - how does it work, who reviews applications?
Work out what job titles you should be looking for
----------->

# What have been the most influential events?

- The act of leaving academia for teaching
<!-------
taking control and making a decision for myself for the first time
--------->
- Realising how much I enjoyed coding and working with data
<!-------
I needed the distance from it to realise this, otherwise it was an invisible given
--------->
- Working with software developers ⭐️
<!-------
--------->
- Learning about the software development cycle (especially tests 🧪)
<!-------
If there are any people in here who code and suffer from imposter syndrome, I'm telling you, learning about and implementing tests are the cure. It cured me.
