# The slow realisation...

- I enjoyed the teaching...and I was good at it
- I did not enjoy the teaching admin
- I really, _really_, _**really**_ missed the data and the coding

---

# Health data science

- **2019-2021: Public Health Scotland**
  - Generic recruitment round for Principal Information Analyst
  - They wanted R skills and familiarity with clinical research
  - Freedom to build a robust system to report on clinical trials
- **2021-2023: University of Oxford**
  - Data scientist at OpenSafely (Prof Ben Goldacre)
  - Working with software engineers and using Python
  - "Start up" mentality - we were on a mission

---

# Health data science

- **2023-present: National Services Scotland**
  - Senior Technical Consultant
  - Developing and maintaining data products used across the NHS
  - First experience of:
    - strict development pipeline (dev &rarr; UAT &rarr; production)
    - enterprise-level business intelligence
    - service delivery - the NHS *relies* on our service being available
    - business analysis/requirements capture

# Recap

![w:1000](img/career_timeline_large.png)

---

# Industry vs academia (vs public services)

- There are no hard and fast rules, but...
  - Academia does not have a monopoly on hard and important problems
  - Large organisations offer the possibility to try something new with less risk
  - Large organisations can be frustratingly slow to modernize
  - Workplace culture can vary dramatically and it is important
  - Academia gives you _a lot_ of transferable skills

---


# What have been the most influential events

- Leaving academia for teaching
  - taking control and making a decision for myself
- Realising just how much I enjoyed coding and working with data
- Working with software developers
- Learning about the software development cycle (including tests 🧪)


---

# What I do now

- Regularly reflect on where I am and what I want (diarise!)
- Move on when I feel I have learned all (most) that I can

---

# Advice

- Try to reflect as much as you can, preferably from a distance
  - what do you enjoy?
  - how do you like to work?
  - what do you want to learn?
  - what gives you energy?
- Be confident that you have skills that are needed elsewhere


- Be brave
- 


In retrospect, what was energising was the coaching and communication aspect of this. Being out in the world.

There was a lot that I did like about academia - working with others, building things, writing, visual communication - but a lot that I didn't like - funding applications, precariousness of contracts

- Career talk
	- Put these slides on Github as pages
	- Notes
		- My academic history - undergrad, masters, PhD (was on a treadmill - felt like I had a plan)
		- After PhD, I had a brief look at jobs, but didn't really know what I was looking for and the first opportunity that arose was a postdoc (through conversation with a visiting lecturer)
		- What this doesn't convey is that throughout this time, I was at various stages of frustration/desperation to leave academia - I'd applied for jobs
		- I knew that I didn't really have the group leader mentality - I wasn't driven by the research questions - I was driven by the process of working together to build something (not easy to tell the difference when you're working in)
		- But I didn't know what else I could do - I didn't feel like I was trained well enough as a software developer, I was mostly working in isolation (technically)
		- Tipping (not breaking) point - school visit that completely energised me
		- Was lucky in that there was funding available that year for people to do PGDE, but I made the decision to leave before I knew that
		- What drew me to teaching is communication and coaching
			- do both of these in most jobs
			- coaching is something that I do now in my private life as well - rowing coaching
	- Try to reflect on what you enjoy - I only realised when I didn't do it any more
	- Try to understand how you like to work - what is important to you? What makes you feel satisfied?
	- To get out of academia - speak to people that work outside of academia, what is the job title?
